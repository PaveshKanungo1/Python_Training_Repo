* if-else Conditionals:
Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified into following types:
if
if-else
if-else-elif
nested if-else-elif.

- if-else:
applePrice = 210
budget = 200
if (applePrice <= budget):
    print("Alexa, add 1 kg Apples to the cart.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.")

- if-else-elif:
num = 0
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num == 0):
    print("Number is Zero.")
else:
    print("Number is positive.")

- nested if-else-elif:
num = 18
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num > 0):
    if (num <= 10):
        print("Number is between 1-10")
    elif (num > 10 and num <= 20):
        print("Number is between 11-20")
    else:
        print("Number is greater than 20")
else:
    print("Number is zero")

________________________________

* match-case statements:
Similar to switch-case statements.
In c++, while using switch-case statements, we are required to use break always but here we are not required to use break, it executes the matched case only.

The match case consists of three main entities :
The match keyword
One or more case clauses
Expression for each case

Syntax:
match variable_name:
            case ‘pattern1’ : //statement1
            case ‘pattern2’ : //statement2
            …            
            case ‘pattern n’ : //statement n

example:
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
# x is the variable to match
match x:
    # if x is 0
    case 0:
        print("x is zero")
    # case with if-condition
    case 4:
        print("case is 4")

    case _ if x!=90:         
        print(x, "is not 90")
    case _ if x!=80:
        print(x, "is not 80")
    case _:
        print(x)

Note: case _: #this means the default case, we can also use if statements in default case

________________________________

* Introduction to Loops:
In python, Based on this loops are further classified into following main types;
for loop
while loop

- The for Loop:
for loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python. Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over strings, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.

Example: iterating over a string:
name = 'Abhishek'
for i in name:
    print(i, end=", ")
Output:
A, b, h, i, s, h, e, k,

Example: iterating over a list:
colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"]
for x in colors:
    print(x)
Output:
Red
Green
Blue
Yellow

Similarly, we can use loops for lists, sets and dictionaries.

- range():
when we want to use for loop for a specific number of times.
Example:
for k in range(5):
    print(k)
Output:
0
1
2
3
4
Here, we can see that the loop starts from 0 by default and increments at each iteration.

But we can also loop over a specific range.

Example:
for k in range(4,9):
    print(k)
Output:
4
5
6
7
8

Positive Step:
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
Output:
1
3
5
7
9
Starts at 1, increments by 2, and stops before 10.
Negative Step:
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)
Output:
10
8
6
4
2

________________________________

* while Loops in Python:
Example:
count = 5
while (count > 0):
  print(count)
  count = count - 1
Output:
5
4
3
2
1

-Else with While Loop:
We can even use the else statement with the while loop. Essentially what the else statement does is that as soon as the while loop condition becomes False, the interpreter comes out of the while loop and the else statement is executed.
Example:
x = 5
while (x > 0):
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
else:
    print('counter is 0')
Output:
5
4
3
2
1
counter is 0

- Here, in python, there is no do-while loop so
- How to emulate do while loop in python?
The most common technique to emulate a do-while loop in Python is to use an infinite while loop with a break statement wrapped in an if statement that checks a given condition and breaks the iteration if that condition becomes true:
Example
while True:
  number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
  print(number)
  if not number > 0:
    break
Output
Enter a positive number: 1
1
Enter a positive number: 4
4
Enter a positive number: -1
-1

* break and continue in python:
same as other languages

* Exception Handling in python:
Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

- Exceptions in Python
Python has many built-in exceptions that are raised when your program encounters an error (something in the program goes wrong).

When these exceptions occur, the Python interpreter stops the current process and passes it to the calling process until it is handled. If not handled, the program will crash.

Python try...except
try….. except blocks are used in python to handle errors and exceptions. The code in try block runs when there is no error. If the try block catches the error, then the except block is executed.

Syntax:
try:
     #statements which could generate 
     #exception
except:
     #Soloution of generated exception
Example:
try:
    num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Number entered is not an integer.")
Output:
Enter an integer: 6.022
Number entered is not an integer.

________________________________

* Finally Clause;
It is generally used for doing the concluding tasks like closing file resources or closing database connection or may be ending the program execution with a delightful message.
Syntax:
try:
   #statements which could generate 
   #exception
except:
   #solution of generated exception
finally:
    #block of code which is going to 
    #execute in any situation

- Example:
try:
    num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Number entered is not an integer.")
else:
    print("Integer Accepted.")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed.")

________________________________

* Raising Custom errors:
In python, we can raise custom errors by using the raise keyword.

salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))
if not 2000 < salary < 5000:
    raise ValueError("Not a valid salary")

- Defining Custom Exceptions:
In Python, we can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that is derived from the built-in Exception class.

Here's the syntax to define custom exceptions:
class CustomError(Exception):
  # code ...
  pass
try:
  # code ...
except CustomError:
  # code...
This is useful because sometimes we might want to do something when a particular exception is raised. For example, sending an error report to the admin, calling an api, etc.

________________________________

* If ... Else in one line:
There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:

a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

- Example
One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

- Another Example
result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
This syntax is equivalent to the following if-else statement:

if condition:
    result = value_if_true
else:
    result = value_if_false

________________________________

* Enumerate function in python:
The enumerate function is a built-in function in Python that allows you to loop over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and get the index and value of each element in the sequence at the same time. Here's a basic example of how it works:

# Loop over a list and print the index and value of each element
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
The output of this code will be:

0 apple
1 banana
2 mango
As you can see, the enumerate function returns a tuple containing the index and value of each element in the sequence. You can use the for loop to unpack these tuples and assign them to variables, as shown in the example above.

- Changing the start index
By default, the enumerate function starts the index at 0, but you can specify a different starting index by passing it as an argument to the enumerate function:

# Loop over a list and print the index (starting at 1) and value of each element
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(index, fruit)
This will output:

1 apple
2 banana
3 mango

________________________________

* Virtual environment:
A virtual environment is a tool used to isolate specific Python environments on a single machine, allowing you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies and packages without conflicts. This can be especially useful when working on projects that have conflicting package versions or packages that are not compatible with each other.

To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the venv module that comes with Python. Here's an example of how to create a virtual environment and activate it:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source myenv/bin/activate
# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
Once the virtual environment is activated, any packages that you install using pip will be installed in the virtual environment, rather than in the global Python environment. This allows you to have a separate set of packages for each project, without affecting the packages installed in the global environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the deactivate command:

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

The "requirements.txt" file
In addition to creating and activating a virtual environment, it can be useful to create a requirements.txt file that lists the packages and their versions that your project depends on. This file can be used to easily install all the required packages in a new environment.

To create a requirements.txt file, you can use the pip freeze command, which outputs a list of installed packages and their versions. For example:

# Output the list of installed packages and their versions to a file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
To install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, you can use the pip install command with the -r flag:

# Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
Using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file can help you manage the dependencies for your Python projects and ensure that your projects are portable and can be easily set up on a new machine.

________________________________

* How import works?
How importing in python works
Importing in Python is the process of loading code from a Python module into the current script. This allows you to use the functions and variables defined in the module in your current script, as well as any additional modules that the imported module may depend on.

To import a module in Python, you use the import statement followed by the name of the module. For example, to import the math module, which contains a variety of mathematical functions, you would use the following statement:

import math
Once a module is imported, you can use any of the functions and variables defined in the module by using the dot notation. For example, to use the sqrt function from the math module, you would write:

import math
result = math.sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0

from keyword
You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the from keyword. For example, to import only the sqrt function from the math module, you would write:

from math import sqrt
result = sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
You can also import multiple functions or variables at once by separating them with a comma:

from math import sqrt, pi
result = sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793

- importing everything
It's also possible to import all functions and variables from a module using the * wildcard. However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and make it harder to understand where specific functions and variables are coming from.
Code:
from math import *
result = sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793

Python also allows you to rename imported modules using the as keyword. This can be useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for a module, or if you want to avoid naming conflicts with other modules or variables in your code.

- The "as" keyword
Code:
import math as m
result = m.sqrt(9)
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
print(m.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793

- The dir function
Finally, Python has a built-in function called dir that you can use to view the names of all the functions and variables defined in a module. This can be helpful for exploring and understanding the contents of a new module.

Command:
import math
print(dir(math))

This will output a list of all the names defined in the math module, including functions like sqrt and pi, as well as other variables and constants.

In summary, the import statement in Python allows you to access the functions and variables defined in a module from within your current script. You can import the entire module, specific functions or variables, or use the * wildcard to import everything. You can also use the as keyword to rename a module, and the dir function to view the contents of a module.

________________________________

* if "__name__" = "__main__" in Python:
if "__name__ == "__main__" in Python
The if __name__ == "__main__" idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

In Python, the __name__ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to the string __main__ When the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module.

Here's an example of how the if __name__ == __main__ idiom can be used:

def main():
    # Code to be run when the script is run directly
    print("Running script directly")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
In this example, the main function contains the code that should be run when the script is run directly. The if statement at the bottom checks whether the __name__ variable is equal to __main__. If it is, the main function is called.

- Why is it useful?
This idiom is useful because it allows you to reuse code from a script by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script. For example, consider the following script:

def main():
    print("Running script directly")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
If you run this script directly, it will output "Running script directly". However, if you import it as a module into another script and call the main function from the imported module, it will not output anything:

import script
script.main()  # Output: "Running script directly"
This can be useful if you have code that you want to reuse in multiple scripts, but you only want it to run when the script is run directly and not when it's imported as a module.

- Is it a necessity?
It's important to note that the if __name__ == "__main__" idiom is not required to run a Python script. You can still run a script without it by simply calling the functions or running the code you want to execute directly. However, the if __name__ == "__main__" idiom can be a useful tool for organizing and separating code that should be run directly from code that should be imported and used as a module.

In summary, the if __name__ == "__main__" idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script. It allows you to reuse code from a script by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script.

* os-module in python:
The os module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as reading and writing files, interacting with the file system, and running system commands.

Reading and writing files The os module provides functions for opening, reading, and writing files. For example, to open a file for reading, you can use the open function:

import os

# Open the file in read-only mode
f = os.open("myfile.txt", os.O_RDONLY)

# Read the contents of the file
contents = os.read(f, 1024)

# Close the file
os.close(f)

- To open a file for writing, you can use the os.O_WRONLY flag:

import os
# Open the file in write-only mode
f = os.open("myfile.txt", os.O_WRONLY)
# Write to the file
os.write(f, b"Hello, world!")
# Close the file
os.close(f)

- Interacting with the file system
The os module also provides functions for interacting with the file system. For example, you can use the os.listdir function to get a list of the files in a directory:

import os
# Get a list of the files in the current directory
files = os.listdir(".")
print(files)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']

- You can also use the os.mkdir function to create a new directory:

import os
# Create a new directory
os.mkdir("newdir")

- Running system commands
Finally, the os module provides functions for running system commands. For example, you can use the os.system function to run a command and get the output:

import os
# Run the "ls" command and print the output
output = os.system("ls")
print(output)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']

- You can also use the os.popen function to run a command and get the output as a file-like object:

import os
# Run the "ls" command and get the output as a file-like object
f = os.popen("ls")
# Read the contents of the output
output = f.read()
print(output)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']
# Close the file-like object
f.close()

________________________________

* local and global variables:
A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. In Python, we can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =. For example:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

- A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function and is only accessible within that function. It is created when the function is called and is destroyed when the function returns.

Example:
x = 10 # global variable
def my_function():
  y = 5 # local variable
  print(y)
my_function()
print(x)
print(y) # this will cause an error because y is a local variable and is not accessible outside of the function

In this example, we have a global variable x and a local variable y. We can access the value of the global variable x from within the function, but we cannot access the value of the local variable y outside of the function.

- The global keyword:
The global keyword is used to declare that a variable is a global variable and should be accessed from the global scope. Here's an example:

x = 10 # global variable
def my_function():
  global x
  x = 5 # this will change the value of the global variable x
  y = 5 # local variable
my_function()
print(x) # prints 5
print(y) # this will cause an error because y is a local variable and is not accessible outside of the function

In this example, we used the global keyword to declare that we want to modify the global variable x from within the function. As a result, the value of x is changed to 5.

It's important to note that it's generally considered good practice to avoid modifying global variables from within functions, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and make your code harder to debug.

________________________________

* Lambda functions in python:
In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function without a name. It is defined using the lambda keyword and has the following syntax:

lambda arguments: expression

Lambda functions are often used in situations where a small function is required for a short period of time. They are commonly used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as map, filter, and reduce.

Here is an example of how to use a lambda function:

# Function to double the input
def double(x):
  return x * 2
# Lambda function to double the input
lambda x: x * 2

The above lambda function has the same functionality as the double function defined earlier. However, the lambda function is anonymous, as it does not have a name.

Lambda functions can have multiple arguments, just like regular functions. Here is an example of a lambda function with multiple arguments:

# Function to calculate the product of two numbers
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
# Lambda function to calculate the product of two numbers
lambda x, y: x * y

Lambda functions can also include multiple statements, but they are limited to a single expression. For example:

# Lambda function to calculate the product of two numbers,
# with additional print statement
lambda x, y: print(f'{x} * {y} = {x * y}')
In the above example, the lambda function includes a print statement, but it is still limited to a single expression.

Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with higher-order functions, such as map, filter, and reduce which we will look into later.

________________________________

* Map, Filter and Reduce functions:
In Python, the map, filter, and reduce functions are built-in functions that allow you to apply a function to a sequence of elements and return a new sequence. These functions are known as higher-order functions, as they take other functions as arguments.

- map
The map function applies a function to each element in a sequence and returns a new sequence containing the transformed elements. The map function has the following syntax:

map(function, iterable)

The function argument is a function that is applied to each element in the iterable argument. The iterable argument can be a list, tuple, or any other iterable object.

Here is an example of how to use the map function:

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Double each number using the map function
doubled = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
# Print the doubled numbers
print(list(doubled))

In the above example, the lambda function lambda x: x * 2 is used to double each element in the numbers list. The map function applies the lambda function to each element in the list and returns a new list containing the doubled numbers.

- filter
The filter function filters a sequence of elements based on a given predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) and returns a new sequence containing only the elements that meet the predicate. The filter function has the following syntax:

filter(predicate, iterable)
The predicate argument is a function that returns a boolean value and is applied to each element in the iterable argument. The iterable argument can be a list, tuple, or any other iterable object.

Here is an example of how to use the filter function:

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Get only the even numbers using the filter function
evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
# Print the even numbers
print(list(evens))

In the above example, the lambda function lambda x: x % 2 == 0 is used to filter the numbers list and return only the even numbers. The filter function applies the lambda function to each element in the list and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

- reduce
The reduce function is a higher-order function that applies a function to a sequence and returns a single value. It is a part of the functools module in Python and has the following syntax:

reduce(function, iterable)
The function argument is a function that takes in two arguments and returns a single value. The iterable argument is a sequence of elements, such as a list or tuple.

The reduce function applies the function to the first two elements in the iterable and then applies the function to the result and the next element, and so on. The reduce function returns the final result.

Here is an example of how to use the reduce function:

from functools import reduce
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Calculate the sum of the numbers using the reduce function
sum = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
# Print the sum
print(sum)

In the above example, the reduce function applies the lambda function lambda x, y: x + y to the elements in the numbers list. The lambda function adds the two arguments x and y and returns the result. The reduce function applies the lambda function to the first two elements in the list (1 and 2), then applies the function to the result (3) and the next element (3), and so on. The final result is the sum of all the elements in the list, which is 15.

It is important to note that the reduce function requires the functools module to be imported in order to use it.

________________________________

* "is" vs "==" in python:
In Python, is and == are both comparison operators that can be used to check if two values are equal. However, there are some important differences between the two that you should be aware of.

The is operator compares the identity of two objects, while the == operator compares the values of the objects. This means that is will only return True if the objects being compared are the exact same object in memory, while == will return True if the objects have the same value.

For example:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # False

In this case, a and b are two separate lists that have the same values, so == returns True. However, a and b are not the same object in memory, so is returns False.

One important thing to note is that, in Python, strings and integers are immutable, which means that once they are created, their value cannot be changed. This means that, for strings and integers, is and == will always return the same result:

a = "hello"
b = "hello"
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # True
a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # True

In these cases, a and b are both pointing to the same object in memory, so is and == both return True.

For mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries, is and == can behave differently. In general, you should use == when you want to compare the values of two objects, and use is when you want to check if two objects are the same object in memory.
