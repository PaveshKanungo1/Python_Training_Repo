## Syntax and Basics
### Concepts:
- Python indentation rules and syntax basics
- Declaring and assigning variables
- Built-in data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `NoneType`
- Operators: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`), logical (`and`, `or`, `not`)

### Assignments:
- **Geometric Shapes Area and Perimeter Calculation**: Calculate the area and perimeter of different shapes (square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle) based on user input. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Basic Statistical Metrics**: Take user input for multiple numbers, store them in a list, and compute basic statistical metrics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Loan Payment Calculation**: Calculate monthly loan payments based on principal, rate of interest, and tenure.

## Control Flow
### Concepts:
- `if-elif-else` statements
- Loops: `for` loops, `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, and `pass
- Exception handling: `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`

### Assignments:
- **Prime/Composite Classification**: Classify numbers as prime, composite, or neither. Handle invalid inputs.
- **Library Menu System**: Implement a simple text-based menu system for a library that allows users to add, remove, search, and list books.
- **ATM Transaction Simulator**: Simulate an ATM with options for checking balances, depositing, withdrawing money, and exiting.

## Functions and Modules
### Concepts:
- Defining and calling functions
- Default arguments and keyword arguments
- Variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`)
- Importing and using modules
- Organizing code into reusable packages
- `__init__.py` file for packages

### Assignments:
- **Product Calculation with *args**: Write a function that accepts `*args` to calculate the product of all numbers provided, with error handling for non-numeric inputs.
- **Modular Program**: Split functionality into separate modules for fetching data, processing it, and reporting results.
- **MathOperations Module**: Create a class-based module for common mathematical functions, and use it in a program.
- **User Authentication Package**: Build a package containing modules for password hashing, login verification, and user activity logging.

## Data Structures
### Concepts:
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets and their methods:
  - Lists: `append()`, `pop()`, `slice()`, `sort()`
  - Tuples: immutability
  - Dictionaries: key-value pairs, accessing values
  - Sets: unique elements, union, intersection

### Assignments:
- **To-Do List Management**: Create a program to manage a to-do list with options for adding, updating, removing, and viewing tasks.
- **Voting System**: Develop a voting system using sets and dictionaries.
- **Library Catalog**: Build a catalog that supports searching by title, author, or category.

## File Handling
### Concepts:
- File operations: `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
- Working with CSV files using the `csv` module
- Handling JSON data with the `json` module

### Assignments:
- **CSV File Analysis**: Analyze a CSV file containing sales data and generate a report.
- **Text File Merging**: Merge multiple text files while handling exceptions.
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Process and validate a JSON file, generating key statistics.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
### Concepts:
- Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods
- Inheritance (Single and Multiple)
- Encapsulation and Polymorphism
- Magic Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.)

### Assignments:
- **Bank Account Class**: Design a `BankAccount` class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.
- **Inventory Management Class**: Create an `Inventory` class to manage stock levels.
- **Employee Salary Calculation**: Design a class hierarchy for employee salary calculations (Full-time, Part-time, Contractor) with tax deductions and Provident Fund (PF).
- **Transaction Class**: Build a `Transaction` class with dunder methods for comparison, addition, and representation.

## Python Development Tools and Advanced Topics
### Concepts:
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) usage: PyCharm, VSCode
- Debugging with breakpoints
- Unit testing using `unittest` and `pytest`
- Package Management with `pip` and `poetry`
- Virtual Environments using `venv` or `virtualenv`
- Advanced topics: Generators, Iterators, List Comprehensions, Lambda Functions, and Decorators

### Assignments:
- **IDE Debugging**: Set up a Python project in PyCharm, use breakpoints, and debug a complex function.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for a prime number function and a basic calculator module.
- **Package Management**: Use `pip` to install libraries and create a `requirements.txt` file.
- **Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment for a project and install dependencies.
- **Advanced Topics**: Implement a Fibonacci generator, a list comprehension for squares, and a decorator for logging execution time.
